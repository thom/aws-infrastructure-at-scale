# Udacity AWS Cloud Architect Program - Project 2: Design, Provision and Monitor AWS Infrastructure at Scale

This project plans, designs, provisions, and monitors infrastructure in AWS using industry-standard and open source tools. It showcases how to optimize infrastructure for cost and performance, and uses Terraform to provision and configure AWS services in a global configuration.

## Task 1: Create AWS Architecture Schematics

### Part 1

Plan and provision a cost-effective AWS infrastructure for a new social media application development project for 50,000 single-region users. The project requires the following AWS infrastructure and services:

- Infrastructure in the following regions: us-east-1
- Users and Client machines
- One VPC
- Two Availability Zones
- Four Subnets (2 Public, 2 Private)
- A NAT Gateway
- A CloudFront distribution with an S3 bucket
- Web servers in the Public Subnets sized according to the usage estimates
- Application Servers in the Private Subnets sized according to the usage estimates
- DB Servers in the Private Subnets
- Web Servers Load Balanced and Autoscaled
- Application Servers Load Balanced and Autoscaled
- A Master DB in AZ1 with a read replica in AZ2
- AWS Route 53

Assumptions:

- 50,000 users
- Web server:
  - 6 x a1.large with Linux and NGINX (see [NGINX whitepaper](https://www.arm.com/-/media/global/solutions/infrastructure/NGINX_A1%20whitepaper.pdf))
  - Amazon Route 53
- Application server:
  - 6 x m5.large
- Structured data is stored in RDS (MySQL):
  - A Master DB in AZ1 with a read replica in AZ2 (db.m5.xlarge)
  - Assumption is that every user creates 1MB of structured data per month:
    - 50GB of structured data added to RDS per month
- Files, pictures and videos are stored in S3, with quotas enforced to prevent overrun:
  - Each user generates 2GB of storage per year: 100TB S3 Intelligent-Tiering
  - In addition to the 2GB for the current year, users can store 20GB (10 years worth of storage): 1000TB S3 Glacier
  - On average every user will create 150MB and consume 1GB data per month:
    - 7.5TB inbound and 50TB outbound traffic
  - On average every user will make 150 PUT and 2000 GET requests per month:
    - 7,500,000 PUT requests and 100,000,000 GET requests overall per month
- NAT gateway:
  - Assumption is that 10GB per month for OS and application updates are needed
- Two application load balancer (public and private):
  - Maximum 50,000 active connections per minute
  - Assume that the average HTTP request/response is 2KB and each user performs 1,500 requests per day
  - This leads to about 90MB of HTTP requests/responses per user per month, 4500GB in total
